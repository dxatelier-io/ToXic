      <p>If you’re here now, maybe it also means that the moment for me to let you go is getting closer. I always wished these words would never reach you, because that would mean i wouldn’t have to let you go ehehe. But here we are.</p>
      <p>Before anything else, thank you for staying with me for as long as you did. I don’t know what day we’re on anymore, but i know this much, i was truly happy because up until this second, you were still here with me.</p>
